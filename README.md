A react app for the website Apple and banana. It includes a landing page, an Articles page and an About page.

This website was inspired by the page collective newsletter of friday 1st October, 2021.
The UI/UX design is hosted on the [page collective site](https://pagecollective.com/post/apple-and-banana/?ref=pagecollective_newsletter)

I am on a mission to populate my portfolio's project section with react projects. This is number 1. Cheers!!!
